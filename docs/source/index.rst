PyFES documentation
===================

This package is the fully revised version of the FES2022 distribution. A full
description of the FES2022 tidal solution is given in the `handbook
<https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/fileadmin/documents/data/tools/hdbk_FES2022.pdf>`_
and in the paper (Lyard et al. 2024).

The library uses a set of tidal components to predict the ocean tide at any
location on the Earth. The source code provides an older version of the FES
model (99), because it is significantly smaller than newer versions. **Do not
use it for scientific purposes**. You can download the model from the `AVISO
<https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/products/auxiliary-products/global-tide-fes.html>`_
website.

Theoretical Background: The Harmonic Method
--------------------------------------------

The prediction of tides is based on the principle of **harmonic analysis**, a
method developed into a practical application by Sir William Thomson
(Lord Kelvin) around 1867. The core idea is that the complex, periodic motion of
the tide at any location can be resolved into the sum of a series of simpler,
regular wave-like components known as **tidal constituents**. Each constituent
corresponds to a distinct astronomical forcing, such as the gravitational pull
of the Moon or Sun, or orbital variations like the evection and variation of the
moon.

As detailed in Schureman's manual [Schureman1940]_, the height of the tide, *h*,
at any time, *t*, can be expressed by the fundamental equation of harmonic
prediction:

.. math::

    h(t) = H_0 + A \cos(at + \alpha) + B \cos(bt + \beta) + C \cos(ct + \gamma) + \dots

Where:
    * :math:`H_0` is the mean height of the water level above the chart datum.
    * Each cosine term represents a single **tidal constituent** (e.g., the
      principal lunar semidiurnal tide, :math:`M_2`; the principal solar
      semidiurnal tide, :math:`S_2`; etc.).
    * Amplitude (:math:`A`, :math:`B`, :math:`C`...): This is the strength, or
      half the range, of each constituent. It is a location-specific value
      determined from the analysis of tidal observations.
    * Speed (:math:`a`, :math:`b`, :math:`c`...): This is the angular speed of
      the constituent, representing how quickly its phase changes. Speeds are
      constant for each constituent and are derived from universal astronomical
      data, such as the rotation of the Earth and the orbital periods of the
      Moon and Sun.
    * Phase Lag (:math:`\alpha`, :math:`\beta`, :math:`\gamma`...): Also known
      as the **epoch** (:math:`\kappa`), this value represents the timing of
      a constituent's high water relative to its theoretical astronomical
      forcing. Like the amplitude, it is a location-specific constant found
      through observation.

The :term:`FES` models, such as FES2022, are sophisticated global atlases that provide
the location-specific amplitudes (:math:`H`) and phase lags (:math:`\kappa`)
for a large number of tidal constituents. The **PyFES** library acts as the
harmonic prediction engine. When a user requests a tide prediction for a
specific location and time, the library:

1.  Retrieves the amplitude and phase for each constituent from the FES model
    maps at the desired location.
2.  Calculates the astronomical argument (the angle inside the cosine function)
    for the specified time using the known astronomical speeds of each constituent.
3.  Applies the fundamental prediction equation shown above, summing the
    contributions of all constituents.
4.  Adds the local mean sea level (:math:`H_0`) to produce the final predicted
    tide height relative to the datum.
