Setup with conda
================

The easiest way to get started with the library is to install it using conda.

`Conda <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html>`_ is an
open-source package management system and environment management system that
runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Conda quickly installs, runs, and updates
packages and their dependencies. Conda easily creates, saves, loads, and
switches between environments on your local computer. It was created for Python
programs, but it can package and distribute software for any language.

The first step is to install conda. The preferred way to install conda is to
install Miniforge, which is a minimal installer for conda. Miniforge is a
distribution of conda that includes only conda, Python, and a small number of
other packages. You can find more information about Miniforge on `GitHub
<https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge>`_.

Then you can install the library using conda. The library is available on the
conda-forge channel. To install the library, you can run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge pyfes
