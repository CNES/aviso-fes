Configuration Files
*******************

This directory contains the different configuration files to compute:

- FES2014 elevations (ocean or geocentric)
    - Use `ocean_tide.ini <ocean_tide.ini>`_ to compute the ocean tide
      with the native grids.
    - Use `ocean_tide_extrapolated.ini <ocean_tide_extrapolated.ini>`_
      to compute the ocean tide with the extrapolated grids.
    - Use `load_tide.ini <load_tide.ini>`_ to compute the load tide.
- FES2014 currents
    - Use `northward_velocity.ini <northward_velocity.ini>`_ to use the
      native grids.
    - Use `eastward_velocity.ini <eastward_velocity.ini>`_ to use the
      native grids.

.. note ::

    The configuration files are supplied for use with the tree as described
    below.

Database Contents
*****************

The various sub directories located here are empty. Indeed, data necessary to
calculate the different tides are not distributed here, but on the
`AVISO <http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/products/auxiliary-products/global-tide-fes/>`_
website. You will find on the AVISO FTP server authenticated the following
archives for filling empty directories:

- eastward_velocity.tar.xz
- load_tide.tar.xz
- northward_velocity.tar.xz
- ocean_tide.tar.xz
- ocean_tide_extrapolated.tar.xz

To allow you to download as small as possible archives, the archives have been
compressed using the `xz <http://tukaani.org/xz>`_ program using the LZMA2
compression algorithms. To decompress the archive, you must use this command or
`7-zip <http://www.7-zip.org/>`_ if you use Windows.

.. note ::

    The decompression of these archives will need 193 MiB of memory.

DATABASE DESCRIPTION
####################

The FES2014 tides database includes 3 components: Tide elevations, currents and
loading. Each component contains 34 tidal components:

    2N₂, J₁, K₁, K₂, L₂, MKS₂, MN₄, MS₄, Mf, Mm, Msf, Msqm, Mtm, M₂, M₃, M₄, M₆, M₈,
    N₂, N₄, O₁, P₁, P₁, R₂, Sa, Ssa, S₁, S₂, S₄, T₂, µ₂, ε₂, λ₂, ν₂

Tide Elevations
***************

FES2014b ocean tide model is distributed; this model has
been computed using the new FES2014 tidal loading grids. Two versions
are available:

  * Non extrapolated version contained in the *ocean_tide.tar.xz* archive: the
    model is defined on a 1/16° grid directly
    interpolated from the finite element native grid of the model.

  * Extrapolated version contained in the *ocean_tide_extrapolated.tar.xz*: the
    above version has been extrapolated on the coasts in order to cover nearly
    entirely the coastal regions. The procedure is a simple extrapolation
    applied on 10 pixels and using mean values when necessary, it cannot be
    accurate enough in some regions.

Tide Currents
*************

Tidal currents derived from FES2014a models are delivered on
the 1/16° grid, directly interpolated from the finite element native grid.
No extrapolation is done on the coasts of the currents. This database is
contained in two separate archives: *eastward_velocity.tar.xz* and
*northward_velocity.tar.xz*.

Tide Loading
************

The new FES2014a tide loading is supplied on the same 1/16° grid. This
dataset is provided into the *load_tide.tar.xz* archive.
