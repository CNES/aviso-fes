 @brief Computes the long-period equilibrium ocean tides.

 The complete tidal spectral lines from the Cartwright-Tayler-Edden
 tables are summed over to compute the long-period tide.
 @n
 Order 2 and order 3 of the tidal potential for the long period waves is
 now taken into account.
 @n
 The decomposition was validated compared to the potential proposed by
 Tamura.
 @n
 Waves computed dynamically are removed.
