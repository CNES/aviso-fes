# DESCRIPTION

This package is the fully revised version of the FES2022 distribution. This
distribution includes the FES2022 tidal prediction software managed on this page
and the [FES2022 tides databases](data/fes2022/README.md) A full description of
the FES2022 tidal solution is given in the handbook
(https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/fileadmin/documents/data/tools/hdbk_FES2022.pdf)
and in the paper (Lyard et al. 2024).

> This new code is under development and it is designed to handle the new finite
> element grids of FES2022. It will become official at the end of this year. For
> now, we do not provide support for this new version.

# CREDITS

When using FES2022, please mention: *FES2022 was produced by LEGOS, NOVELTIS and
CLS Ocean and Climate Division; the project was funded by CNES. It is
distributed by AVISO, with support from CNES (http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/)*

# DOCUMENTATION

The documentation of the FES2022 software is available on the readthedocs

# LEGACY C VERSION

The legacy C version of the FES software is available on his own branch:
https://github.com/CNES/aviso-fes/tree/legacy-c-version-archive

The reference version to compute the FES2022b tidal solution is
