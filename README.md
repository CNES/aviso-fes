# DESCRIPTION

This package is the fully revised version of the FES2014 distribution.
This distribution includes the FES2014 tidal prediction software managed on this
page and the FES2014 tides databases available on
[AVISO website](http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/products/auxiliary-products/global-tide-fes/)

The FES2014 tides database includes 3 components:

1. **Tide elevations**: FES2014b ocean tide model is distributed; this model has
been computed using the new FES2014 tidal loading grids. Two versions
are available:

  * Non extrapolated version: the model is defined on a 1/16° grid directly
    interpolated from the finite element native grid of the model. Filenames
    are ``WAVE_FES2014b_elev.nc``.

  * Extrapolated version: the above version has been extrapolated on the
    coasts in order to cover nearly entirely the coastal regions. The
    procedure is a simple extrapolation applied on 10 pixels and using mean
    values when necessary, it can be not enough accurate in some regions.
    Filenames are ``WAVE_FES2014b_elev_extrapol.nc``.

2. **Tide currents**: tidal curents derived from FES2014a model are delivered on
the 1/16° grid, directly interpolated from the finite element native grid.
No extrapolation is done on the coasts for the currents. Filenames are
``WAVE_FES2014a_uv.nc``.

3. **Tide loading**: the new FES2014a tide loading (noted FES2014_load) grids
are supplied on the same 1/16° grid.

FES2014_load must be used to compute the FES2014 geocentric (elastic) tide.
Filenames are ``WAVE_FES2014_load.nc``.

The tides database contains 34 tidal components for each tide product: 2N2,
Eps2, J1, K1, K2, L2, La2, M2, M3, M4, M6, M8, Mf, MKS2, Mm, MN4, MS4, MSf,
MSqm, Mtm, Mu2, N2, N4, Nu2, O1, P1, Q1, R2, S1, S2, S4, Sa, Ssa, T2.

> To produce FES2014 tidal prediction with the software, you need to use
> the following parameter files:
> 
>   * FES2014 elevations (ocean or geocentric) tide: use
> `fes2014b_elev.ini`
>     or `fes2014b_elev_extrapol.ini`
> 
>   * FES2014 currents: use `fes2014a_u.ini` and `fes2014a_v.ini`

# CREDITS

When using FES2014, please mention: *FES2014 was produced by NOVELTIS, LEGOS,
CLS Space Oceanography Division and CNES. It is distributed by AVISO, with
support from CNES (http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/)*

# HOW TO INSTALL THE SOFTWARE ?

The complete description of the build method is described in the
[INSTALL](INSTALL) file located in the root of this software.

# HOW TO USE THE SOFTWARE ?

This distribution contains a C API to be used to calculate the tide. The
[API](API.rst) documentation describes the functions to be used to
perform the calculation. The directory [examples](examples) contains an
example of using this API.
